\section{Introduction}
	This is a thesis about finding architectural knowledge in emails! Wow!

\section{Categorization of Architectural Knowledge}
	According to Tom's research \cite{denBoon21} we know lots about architecture.

\section{Preparing Data for Analysis}
	While den Boon's ArchDetector web application provided a solid foundation for extracting normalized data from various Apache mailing lists (in the form of \textit{mbox} files) and Jira issues\cite{denBoon21}, it was not designed with the foresight to accommodate further developments, so a new, simple command-line application was developed to improve collaborative workflow of categorizing and exporting data.
	
	This application is called \textbf{ak-tagger}, and its source and usage documentation may be viewed online at \href{https://github.com/andrewlalis/ArchitecturalKnowledgeResearch}{this paper's associated GitHub repository}. A short description of its functionality will be supplied inline with this paper, but please refer to the online documentation for any further information or to report issues.
	
	\subsection{About the ak-tagger Program}
		The architectural knowledge tagger program, colloquially known as \textbf{ak-tagger}, functions as a companion to the ArchDetector web application, that provides a more efficient interface for tagging and evaluating the categorization of sources of architectural knowledge, and sharing this information with others. The program is written in the \href{https://dlang.org/}{D programming language}, and can be compiled to a native executable with any D compiler (DMD, GDC, LDC) that provides the \textbf{dub} build tool.
		
		The ak-tagger program works with raw JSON data sets that are grouped into files based on the query that produced the set of results. Thus the program is designed primarily as a tool for analysis of prepared search queries and their results, as obtained from an instance of the ArchDetector REST API.

		There program has several distinct functionalities:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Fetch} - The user is able to fetch a raw dataset from the ArchDetector API and save it to a JSON file for sharing or their own use.
			\item \textbf{Use} - Fetched datasets may be explored and categorized with a simple interactive command-line interface. Offers utilities such as exporting email threads as formatted text files for easy viewing, and modifying an email thread's set of tags.
			\item \textbf{Inspect} - Datasets may be inspected to produce formatted aggregate information that's easier to use than the entire raw JSON file, including some aggregate information.
		\end{enumerate}
	
		The general workflow for a user is to first \textit{fetch} a dataset from ArchDetector, then save it as a JSON file.
